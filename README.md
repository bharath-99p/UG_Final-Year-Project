In the pursuit of enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of transportation, this study presents a comprehensive modeling and simulation framework for fuel cell hybrid vehicles (FCHVs) using Simulink and Simscape. FCHVs integrate fuel cell stacks, batteries, electric motors, power electronics, and vehicle dynamics, posing a complex system to simulate. Our approach enables the analysis of key performance metrics such as fuel consumption, energy efficiency, power delivery, and vehicle dynamics under various driving conditions. Leveraging Simulink's capabilities, we implement the model to simulate FCHV operation, allowing for the evaluation of hybridization strategies and control algorithms. The results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our model in real-world applications, offering valuable insights for system optimization and control algorithm development. By contributing to the advancement of FCHV technology, this research aims to foster the adoption of sustainable transportation solutions, thereby mitigating environmental impacts and promoting energy efficiency in the vehicular industry.
